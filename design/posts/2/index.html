<h2>Preface: A game and its rules</h2>
<i>
<p>
"Given a chessboard and a knight, can you find a path that will cover each cell once and exactly
once? If you are able to do so faster than me you stand to win a fortune." 
<p>- The prince of Hamilton</p>
<p>P.S. </p>

<p>
Don't tell my dad I gamble for money</i>
</p>

<h2>Chapter 1: An impatient knight</h2>
<p>
A long time ago, in the old country of Hamilton, we find a brave young man riding a horse.
Conflicted between the thrill of becoming an independent man and the distress of being
sent away by his family, he confidently traverses the various terrains towards the royal palace.
</p>

<p>
As the sun went down, our protagonist decided to take shelter in a small cabin. Although the 
cabin was made of simple wooden logs, the ingenious structure suggested an owner that is smarter
than most of its kind. The entrance was a small space between two life size, wooden statues of
a king and queen as found on a chessboard. Inside, the floor was made of black and white tiles.
One of walls had a poem on it: <i>If shadow and light is a line you do not believe in,
  add up down to left right and see if it is even.</i>
<p>

<p>
As part of the payment for the overnight stay, the knight promised the isolated cabin owner to
humor him with his life story. Next to the fireplace, accompanied by a pot of strong black
coffee, the knight began: "As all boys in my family I am to leave my home at the age of 18, not
to return until I have made my own fortune. This is the fate that my father and his fathers
before him have suffered and been molded by." "And how will you, suffering young man, make
your fortune?" the cabin owner asked. The knight proudly raised his chin and announced: "I will
challenge the prince to a Knight's Tour. It is widely known that the winner is greatly rewarded."
The cabin owner made a concerned face and asked: "Does the prize constitute an object on the
first cell of chessboard, double on the second and so forth?" Slightly rattled by the very
specific question the knight refuted that price would be a constant sum of money.
</p>

<p>
As the conversation progresses the knight became more and more insecure. It was only now, when
forced to formulate his ideas into words and sentences that he realized how unprepared he was.
The cabin owner noticed his realization, took pity in his situation, and decided to help him.
"Long ago, I was a student of pure mathematics and worked on the Knight's Tour problem 
for very long." He compassionately hands the knight 
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/0166-218X(92)00170-Q" target="_blank">a document.</a>.
"It is very technical so please take your time to study it carefully." 
</p>

<p>
But the words of the cabin owner would fall on deaf ears as the knight quickly browsed through
all the pages. Back in his room, under the light of a dying candle, he read the following
fact: <i>for an 8x8 chessboard there are 26,534,728,821,064 ways to complete a tour.</i> "What
an incomprehensible gargantuan number!" the knight thought to himself. "I will go to the prince
and challenge him, with so many solutions it is only a matter of chance until my guess beats
his, skill does not defeat probability!"
</p>

<p>
The cabin owner found himself being not at all surprised as he stumbled upon an empty bed that
morning. The same bed the knight, contrary to most other days, was not thinking about as he
galloped his horse onto the palace grounds. He tied his horse to the pole next to a small
fountain; the animal gratefully indulged. At the main gate a bishop was reading a small
bible in the shade. The knight politely asked him where he may find the Prince of Hamilton. 
<i>"God does not play dice, and man should not either."</i> the bishop answered disapprovingly,
as he pointed diagonally towards the field next to the royal garden. 
</p>

<p>
The prince was lying on his back, looking at the clouds. His head swiftly lifted up as he heard
the knight's footsteps approaching. Both of them knew why they were there. 
</p>

<p>
Our Knight would later vividly recall the humiliating situation that took place in the
garden. He and the prince started on opposite corners of a 6x6 chessboard, a board size 
normally reserved for children. Regardless, our knight simply hopped in any random direction,
constantly finding himself stuck on a cell without having visited all of them. In his distress
he did not notice that the prince, somewhat similarly, is not completing the tour without 
stopping sometimes, but he then retraces a few steps before proceeding instead of
starting all over again. With tears of shame and anger burning behind his eyes, 
the knight returned to the cabin.

<h2>Chapter 2: We must go deeper</h2>
<p>
  The cabin owner, although truly feeling compassion towards the knight, also
  felt content with knowing the knight would be around for a while. The next day
  he took the knight out for a walk in the nearby forest. He pointed at the trees
  and with a soft voice started to describe how the each branch itself looks like
  a three, albeit smaller. Symptomatic of overcoming his latest brush with defeat,
  the knight started to climb up in one of the trees. Although not fully realizing
  the meaning behind the cabin owner's words, he appreciated the insight and felt
  it ought to be meaningful someday.
</p>

<p>
  That evening, the cabin owner showed the knight a different puzzle, a maze to
  be precise. "Neither my mind nor my writing hand has the endurance to work out
  such a large maze!" the knight screamed. With a grin the cabin owner answered:
  "Good, now that we have established that, we can think of a way to do this better."
  The cabin owner reached in a cabinet and took out a robust laptop with a mechanical 
  keyboard. "Perhaps we can just focus on a way to think about how to solve it and leave
  the actual calculations to the computer," the cabin owner proposed.
</p>

<p>
  After hours of puzzling the knight was now completely familiar with the concept
  of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search">'Depth First Search'</a>.
  "It is just like the trees in the forest!" the knight yelled euphorically. Inside
  the knights head the cogs started turning.. "Well if you have a chessboard, each cell
  marked with the order of visiting it, or a 0 if it has never been visited, than we can
  consider each possible move a sub tree of that 'node'! My fortune must be somewhere
  at the top of the three, like a golden leaf! The prince did not say anything
  about using computers, I can simply program this out and let the computer find the solution!"

<p>
Without damaging his ego the knight was now able to see that victory was not yet in
sight. The cabin owner had taught him to call the devil by his name 'exponential complexity'.
Not only did he remember that the prince was able to solve the 6 by 6 board much faster
than 39 seconds, he also knew that the 6 by 6 board was merely a warm up. However, following
the exponential curve it would seem that solving the tour on boards larger than that would
take minutes and quickly hours or days. As the sun set completely, the golden glow that
seemed to radiate from the leaves, fades leaving a colorless soon to be compost.
</p>

<h2>Chapter 3: Taking a step back</h2>

<p>
At a loss for thinking of a better algorithm, the knight focused on optimizing the current
one. He noticed how having to copy every board state to generate a successor was a non
trivial operation compared to the rest. Furthermore, having to hold the stack in memory
did feel a little redundant.
<p>

<p>
Deep in the cellar of the cabin, a place filled with books and dust, the knight found
a document on <a href="https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtracking">Backtracking</a>. At
first glance it appeared to be analogous to depth first search, but there were some
benefits. First of all, there was no need to pop and push to a stack<sup>(*1)</sup>.
Secondly, no copy of the board was needed, at every level of recursion the same board
could be mutated in place. 
</p>

<p>
The knight spent the rest of the week sweating away implementing the Knight's Tour
solver using a backtracking approach. When it was finally ready, he couldn't wait
to try out his new solution and ran it for a 6x6 board: 5.36 seconds! His heart started
racing and a feeling of euphoria as he remembered the prince having to think a bit more
than 5.36 seconds. Just to make sure he also plugged in 7x7: 0.34 seconds! Phenomenal!
"If the devil is exponential, then god must be inverse exponential," the knight
triumphantly thought to himself.
</p>

<p>
His memory seemed to have served him correctly. The prince gave a small bow as he
managed to beat him on the 6x6. "My congratulations my good man, but you know that
to win the fortune you must beat me on not only 6x6 board, several larger ones as
well," said the prince. The knight confidently followed the prince to another
part of the garden where a 6x7 board was located. "Let's take it one step further,"
said the prince invitingly. With the memory of the incredible speed in which he was
able to solve a 7x7 he was already daydreaming of the surprised look the prince
will have after beating him.
</p>

<p>
Frustratingly, the truth could not be further removed from his dreams, as even after
10 minutes, when the prince had long completed his tour, the knight was still
backtracking. Feeling more flabbergasted than sad, he congratulated the prince and
took of again to the old familiar cabin.

      quick solution with this algorithm.)

<h2>Chapter 4: Depression, Despair, and Death</h2>
<p>
The knight was unable to hold back a few tears as he attended the
funeral of the cabin owner. He was the only soul there, a fact only
contributing to the tragedy. It had taken the knight multiple days
to carve out the text in the gravestone. He found it only appropriate
to make the cabin owner's most famous words were to ring into eternity:

<p>
<i>"If a work of fiction burns in a fire then the story dies with its
writer. If a work of science burns in a fire, only the name of the
author changes."</i> 
</p>

<p>
The knight's soft sobbing changed to laughter because he only just now
realised the irony of feeling resentment towards the cabin owner
for not ever revealing the solution of that cursed cursed game.
</p>

<h2>Chapter 5: Sciens ex machina</h2>
<p>
His head was covered in sweat. The sheets were largely on the ground.
The knight was heaving a nightmare<sup>(*2)</sup>. "No more ideas, oh
brave knight," said the demon mockingly with a deep voice. "Your parents
must be celebrating, they knew you would never be smart enough to make
a fortune." The knight was paralyzed, it felt like the gravity dial
was turned way up. Then something grabbed him by the hand and flew with
him in the air.
</p>

<p>
After an incomprehensible flight path, he was gracefully laid down in a 
soft green patch of grass. The creature that had brought him there landed
next to him. "What were you thinking, wandering so far from the human world,"
the creature began. "Have your parents never told you to first look for
answers close by? If you run all the way around the world you might not
find the gold buried in your backyard. It's all about heuristics really..."
</p>

<p>
The knight woke up feeling like his head was hit with a brick. That feeling
would persist until well after sunset when it suddenly started to retreat.
Like ebb and flow the headache replaced itself with an unprecedented clarity
and one word from all the books in the cabin's cellar echoed in his skull:
"Warndorff, Warndorff, Warndorff..."
</p>

<p>
In the weeks following the cabin owner's death, the knight had spent most of
his time on taking care of the cabin and rarely thought of the Knight's Tour.
When he did try to gain more knowledge by scrolling through the old books, he
was often distracted by his persisting grief. Yet that evening, having reflected
all day on his dream it all seemed to come together. Every word he read but
forget came surging back into his conciousness. "Warndorff.. Warndorff.. Warndorff's
method!," his memory screamed. It was all so clear now. Backtracking is not that
bad of an idea at all but it matters which path you choose. That's why the results
varied so much, sometimes he was just lucky choosing the right move. Backtracking is
of course based on the fact that you do not know the correct path upfront but that
doesn't mean that you cannot make an educated guess. It's like the winged creature
from his dream suggested, if go far from home to find adventure you will miss the
small adventures close by forever. Just like the cells on the chessboard, if you
do not visit the cells that are almost boxed in you may never see them again! You
first got to choose the nearly closed doors before exploring new ones. That's the
heuristic! Choose a move that has the least follow up moves first!

Never before had a prince experienced that much agony and confusion as the time
a most determined knight did challenge him again; For with a broad smile on his face, the 
knight went home with a fortune that no could one ever take away from him. When somebody
would ever ask him about his fortune he would simply say <i>"If a work of fiction 
burns in a fire then the story dies with its writer. If a work of science 
burns in a fire, only the name of the author changes."</i> 

<h2>Epilogue</h2>
What the knight had learned was not simply the meaning of fortune, nor
that the value of life did not have any monetary value. Not even that taking
care of a cabin in the woods sounds like a pretty neat idea. Whilst al those thing
might be true, the real lesson is that an algorithm and its respective complexity
alone is not always enough to make a judgement. Heuristics may not change
the fact that it takes O(n<sup>2</sup>) to solve the Knight's Problem, yet it
matters a hell of lot.

<h2>Notes</h2>

<span class="citings">
  <p>
  *1 <i>Granted, the previously explicit stack is now obscured by, well literally
    the process' stack in order to manage all the recursive calls. Backtracking is
    therefore not significantly less memory intense (in fact, neither DFS nor backtracking
    are memory intense at all)</i>
  </p>
  
  <p>
  *2 <i>This phenomenon is more commonly known as a 'knightmare'</i>
  </p>

  <p>
  *3 <i>The inverse, 100x40, takes ages (longer than my patience at least), 
    I have no idea why. Please let me know if you have any idea. (edit: my
    hyphothesis is that the unmeaningful order of moves are preserved when
    heuristic is equal. It might be benificial to make the getMoves() method
    return the moves in a more semantically meaningful order, like as clockwise vectors)</i>
