  <p>
    For a recent project I found the need to partition a list of errors into
    <b>user</b> and <b>server</b> errors... on the type level. This would allow me to properly
    define a servant definition that is transparent about which errors are returned along with the
    400 HTTP status code, and which would be send as a 500. This information can then be utilized
    to automatically generate OpenAPI documentation, which is turning out to be an incredibly powerful
    tool. It allows developers to easily and quickly test an endpoint, reviewers to spot any breaking
    changes in the API, and other teams to do their thing without requiring much assistance.
  </p>

  <p>
    Here is an impression of how the errors are defined:
  </p>

  {% call macros.code("haskell") %}
  {-# LANGUAGE DerivingStrategies #-}

  class IsError err where
    type IsUserError err :: Bool

  newtype UserError x = UserError x
  instance IsError (UserError x) where
    type IsUserError (UserError x) = True

  newtype ServerError x = ServerError x
  instance IsError (ServerError x) where
    type IsError (ServerError x) = True

  data InvalidParameter = InvalidTimestamp | InvalidSortKey
    deriving IsError via UserError InvalidParameter

  data DatabaseError = UnparsableStoredObject | UnkownDbError
    deriving IsError via ServerError DatabaseError
  {% endcall %}

  <p>
    With that we can create a special servant http verb that can be transparent about the errors it can throw.
    Moreover, by employing a type family we can distinquish between user and server errors and choose a more
    appropriate http return code.
  </p>

  {% call macros.code("haskell") %}
  {-# LANGUAGE DataKinds #-}
  {-# LANGUAGE TypeFamilies #-}

  import qualified Servant.API as Servant

  type family FilterUserErrors (errs :: [Type]) :: [Type] where
    FilterUserErrors '[] = '[]
    FilterUserErrors (e ': es) = If (IsUserError e) (e ': FilterUserErrors es) (FilterUserErrors es)

  type family FilterServerErrors (errs :: [Type]) :: [Type] where
    FilterServerErrors '[] = '[]
    FilterServerErrors (e ': es) = If (IsUserError e) (FilterServerErrors es) (e ': FilterServerErrors es)

  type VerbWithErrors method contentTypes errs res =
    UVerb
      method
      contentTypes
      '[ WithStatus 200 res
       , WithStatus 400 (Servant.Union (FilterUserErrors errs))
       , WithStatus 500 (Servant.Union (FilterServerErrors errs))
       ]
  {% endcall %}

  <p>
    And this worked splendidly! Or at least for a while. Because as the application grew, we very abruptly ran
    in the problem of unreasonably slow compile time after going from 11 to 13 errors.
    The server module now took 3 minutes to compile!
  </p>

  <p>
    You might expect that the type checker would be given a lot of extra work with this approach and would be the reason
    for the slowdown, but this is actually not case.
    With the help of <a href='https://github.com/codedownio/time-ghc-modules'>time-ghc-modules</a> I was able to identify
    GHC's simplifier as the source of the slowdown.
    Not really expecting to learn much from it, I compiled with the -ddump-simpl flag to be able to inspect the Core representation
    at each stage of the simplifier. But without even looking at it, I could see something was off: the pretty printed Core was gigabytes
    in size! All the while the server module was only a couple hundred lines of code.
    Glancing at the Core identified the suspect: A LOT of typelevel occurances of the <b>If</b> constructor.
  </p>

  <p>
    The issue is that <b>If</b> is just a constructor and is not actually being reduced by the compiler. As a result, both
    recursive calls to the filter are expanded and an exponential size type level term is created! To be precise, \(2 ^ n\).
    To resolve this, we need to reformulate the type family to only have 1 recursive call.
    It might seem obvious when I give you the answer, but I can assure you that I would not have been able to crack the case
    without the help of <a href='https://andres-loeh.de/'>Andres LÃ¶h</a> at Zurihac 2024.

  {% call macros.code("haskell") %}
  type family FilterUserErrors (xs :: [Type]) :: [Type] where
    FilterUserErrors '[] = '[]
    FilterUserErrors (x ': xs) = ConditionalCons (IsUserError x) x (FilterUserErrors xs)

  type family FilterServerErrors (xs :: [Type]) :: [Type] where
    FilterServerErrors '[] = '[]
    FilterServerErrors (x ': xs) = ConditionalCons (Not (IsUserError x)) x (FilterServerErrors xs)

  type family ConditionalCons (b :: Bool) (x :: Type) (xs :: [Type]) where
    ConditionalCons True x xs = x : xs
    ConditionalCons False _ xs = xs
  {% endcall %}

  With this very subtle redefinition the compile time of the server modules was reduced from 3 minutes to 4 seconds!
  Developing is fun once more!
