    This wonderful episode of Cracking the Cryptic piqued my curiosity:

    Not because I wanted to grab some paper can pencil and give it a shot myself, but
    because I was curious to see if I could Z3 to solve it from my current go-to
    programming language, Rust.
  </p>

  <h3>Puzzle rules</h3>

  <p>
    In case you have not seen the video, the puzzle works as follows:

    <ul>
      <li>The puzzle is a 8x8 grid.</li>
      <li>Rows and columns must contain 1 to 8 exactly once.</li>
      <li>The regular 3x3 rule does not apply.</li>
      <li>Each horizontal pair - or domino - of digits (with the exception of those in the right most
        column) make up the coordinates (row, column) of
      another cell. The value of that cell must be equal to the row the domino is in.</li>
    </ul>

    The initial configuration contains just a single known cell with value 1.
  </p>

  <h3>Modeling the puzzle</h3>

  <p>
    First step is to make a new Rust project and add the Z3 crate to the dependencies.
  </p>

  {% call macros.code("sh") %}
  $ cargo new --bin z3_sudoku
  $ cd z3_sudoku
  $ cargo add z3
  {% endcall %}

  <p>
    Next, we need to model the puzzle in Z3. We will need to create a new context and solver.
  </p>

  {% call macros.code("rust") %}
  use z3::{
    ast::{self, Ast},
    Config, Context, Solver,
  };

  fn main() {
    let cfg = Config::new();
    let ctx = Context::new(&cfg);
    let solver = Solver::new(&ctx);
  }
  {% endcall %}

  Then we need to create a set of 64 variables that represent the cells of the board.
  We store them in an 8x8 matrix to match the layout of the board. We also add the
  constraint that the value must be in the range [1,8].

  {% call macros.code("rust") %}
  let mut board = Vec::new();
  for y in 0..8 {
      let mut row = Vec::new();
      for x in 0..8 {
          let cell_name = format!("cell_{}_{}", x, y);
          let cell = ast::Int::new_const(&ctx, cell_name);

          // Each cell must be in the range [1,8]
          solver.assert(&cell.ge(&ast::Int::from_i64(&ctx, 1)));
          solver.assert(&cell.le(&ast::Int::from_i64(&ctx, 8)));
          row.push(cell);
      }
      board.push(row);
  }
  {% endcall %}

  <p>
  Let's first model the constraint that each row and column must contain 1 to 8 exactly once. This requires some thought because a statement like that is not directly expressible in Z3. Luckily, we can decompose that statement into two simpler constraints:

  <ul>
    <li>Each cell must be in the range [1,8]</li>
    <li>Each cell must be not equal to any other cell in the same row or column</li>
  </ul>

  The first constraint was already imposed on each cell when we created the variables.
  The second constraint can be simplified because inequality is commutative. So we only
  have to check each unique pair of cells in the same row or column. In other words, we only have to check that a cell is not equal to every cell that appears before that cell in each row or colunn. Note that I also added some
  helper functions to make the expression of inequalities a bit more readable.

  </p>

  {% call macros.code("rust") %}
  // On the top level
  trait Z3Eq {
    fn z3_eq(&self, other: &Self) -> ast::Bool;
    fn z3_neq(&self, other: &Self) -> ast::Bool;
  }

  impl<'a> Z3Eq for ast::Int<'a> {
      fn z3_eq(&self, other: &Self) -> ast::Bool {
          self._eq(other)
      }
      fn z3_neq(&self, other: &Self) -> ast::Bool {
          self._eq(other).not()
      }
  }

  // Continuing in the main function
  // each row must be contains 1 to 8 precisely once
  for row in 0..8 {
      for column_lhs in 0..7 {
          for column_rhs in (column_lhs + 1)..8 {
              let cell_lhs = &board[row][column_lhs];
              let cell_rhs = &board[row][column_rhs];
              solver.assert(&cell_lhs.z3_neq(&cell_rhs));
          }
      }
  }

  // each column must be contains 1 to 8 precisely once
  for column in 0..8 {
      for row_lhs in 0..7 {
          for row_rhs in (row_lhs + 1)..8 {
              let cell_lhs = &board[row_lhs][column];
              let cell_rhs = &board[row_rhs][column];
              solver.assert(&cell_lhs.z3_neq(&cell_rhs));
          }
      }
  }
  {% endcall %}

  <p>
    At this point we can already try to run the solver to see if it can generate a
    solutions that satisfy the constraints we have defined so far. The only
    thing left is to set our known value and call the solver, and then print
    the result.
  </p>

  {% call macros.code("rust") %}
  // known values
  solver.assert(&board[7][3].z3_eq(&ast::Int::from_i64(&ctx, 1)));

  assert_eq!(solver.check(), z3::SatResult::Sat);
  let m = solver.get_model().unwrap();

  for row in 0..8 {
      for column in 0..8 {
          let cell = &board[row][column];
          print!("{} ", m.eval(cell, true).unwrap());
      }
      println!();
  }
  {% endcall %}

  Running the program takes a good few seconds on my machine. The runtime is likely
  pretty bad because there many valid solutions, and thus the solver doesn't get many
  opportunities to prune large portions of the search space. But it does eventually
  produce a valid solution!

  {% call macros.code("sh") %}
  3 8 4 2 1 5 7 6
  1 4 8 5 3 2 6 7
  7 2 5 8 6 4 3 1
  4 1 3 6 8 7 5 2
  6 5 2 4 7 8 1 3
  2 7 6 3 5 1 8 4
  8 3 1 7 4 6 2 5
  5 6 7 1 2 3 4 8
  {% endcall %}

  <p>
  So now that we know that our solver setup works as expected, we can finally the add
  the most interesting constraint: the one that enforces the relationship between
  the dominos and the cells they represent.
  </p>

  {% call macros.code("rust") %}
  // For each row
  for row in 0..8 {
      // each domino starting in the first 7 columns (remember, now dominos cover
      // the last column)
      for domino_lhs in 0..6 {
          // The right side of the domino is always one column to the right
          let domino_rhs = domino_lhs + 1;
          let lhs = &board[row][domino_lhs];
          let rhs = &board[row][domino_rhs];
          // For every possible value of the left side
          for lhs_value in 1..=8i64 {
              // For every possible value of the right side
              for rhs_value in 1..=8i64 {
                  let target = &board[lhs_value as usize - 1][rhs_value as usize - 1];
                  println!("lhs({}) = {}, rhs({}) = {} => target({})", domino_lhs, lhs_value, domino_rhs, rhs_value, row+1);
                  // Using an implication we can express what would appear to be a circular
                  // reasoning! Only if our speculation of the value of the left and right
                  // side of the domino is correct, does the domino rule apply!
                  solver.assert(&z3::ast::Bool::implies(
                      &z3::ast::Bool::and(
                          &ctx,
                          &[
                              &lhs.z3_eq(&ast::Int::from_i64(&ctx, lhs_value)),
                              &rhs.z3_eq(&ast::Int::from_i64(&ctx, rhs_value)),
                          ],
                      ),
                      // +1 because we need to convert the index to the value
                      &target.z3_eq(&ast::Int::from_i64(&ctx, row as i64 + 1)),
                  ));
              }
          }
      }
  }
  {% endcall %}

  <p>
    Having added those constraints before calling the solver, we get the final solution
    to our puzzle (which in fact matches the one from the video). Interestingly enough,
    although we made the problem much more complicated by adding extra constraints, the
    solver is actually much much faster! This is because the new constraints actually
    reduce the search space significantly.

  <h3>Summary</h3>

  <p>
    We converted a puzzle description into a set of variables and constraints that the
    Z3 model checker can understand and solve. We did this using the Rust language and
    the Z3 crate. Once the program was completed, the computer was able to solve the
    puzzle in the blink of an eye.
  </p>

  <p>
    Hopefully this post has shown how magical Z3 can feel and how you can easily get
    started with it in Rust. If you are interesting in using Z3 in other languages,
    I actually have an older post where I use Z3 from Haskell: {{ macros.refPost(15) }}.
