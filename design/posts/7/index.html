This a first hand account of being a participant of the <a href="https://challengethecyber.nl/ctc-2020">Challenge the Cyber</a> 
Bootcamp. This story started with my somewhat spontaneous decision to follow up on an invite to play in a capture the flag
competition, which would be a first for me. Here we were, five of us, inexperienced, unacquainted, yet very much excited. 
Over the course of the next few hours we treated ourselves with lavish doses of dopamine by solving the puzzles and climbing 
the scoreboard against all our perceived odds. In the end, we read with disbelief: <i>7: The Bin Folders</i>, a team name that, 
whilst sounding generic and 'cyber' enough to hide in plain sight, was actually a literal translation of an obscure, dutch euphemism for 
noble men who drink beer in large quantity, a joke so subtle that I didn't find out until after.
</p>

<p>
As it turned out, the event itself served as a preselection to the aforementioned bootcamp, and we as a team had secured 1 spot.
My general distaste for planning and previously established plan to not do anything for the entire summer had yielded its results;
with the bootcamp only one week away, I was the only member of the noble, beer drinking, and generally employed team at liberty
to enjoy a week of on-site hacking. At the bootcamp I was joined by a generally younger, generally smarter congregation of
ctf enthusiasts. Fascinatingly enough, we seemed to form anecdotal evidence that age and skill are negatively correlated. 
</p>

<p>
The camp's location invoked nostalgic memories of the boy scouts and school trips. Unlike those times however, the organisation
never felt the need to over explain or manage us at all. Even the younger members, some of whom were still subjected to a bedtime
at home mind you, were deservedly entrusted with full individual responsibility. Of course we took turns doing the dishes and sacrificing
a costly 15 minutes of sleep to make breakfast preparations. And costly they were, with intense courses everyday from 9:00 to around 22:00 
and a miserably opaque set of curtains, sleep quickly became valuable commodity. Especially when taking into consideration that it should go
without saying that the personal hacking projects would not be left unattended during those last evening hours before lights out. Simpler beings
may tend to tamagotchis, we were hacking the planet.

On the first day, all getting up to speed on the latest cooking technique's known by the CyberChef, my eyes would occasionally twitch as I was
eagerly anticipating the moment that we would be unleashed on a website full of holes. I imagined the party ripping it apart just like those
Uruk-hai in the second Lord of the Rings movie; <i>Looks like meat's back on the menu boys!</i>. I bought the hole menu on that website, after
all, the coupon codes were an encoded representation of their validity and reduction rate. Bin Folders get 99% discount.

Another quality a hacker should poses: explaining to the rest of the world what the problem is and getting the money in the right place. It's actually
just like hacking: 1. gathering intelligence from the people in charge, no doubt obfuscated, cryptic, and possible served with onions. 2. Process the
results, lay statements next to a person's profile and access risk. 3. Lay out a plan of attack and carefully execute it. If all goes well, you can
celebrate, you just made the world a safer place. It was enlighting really
