<p>
    In this post we will take a look at what it takes to create an embedded language: a language contained and used from within a different language.
    The host language of choice will be haskell, which will provide us with powerful typechecking utilities that can decide whether our embedded program
    is admissible at compile time. 
</p>

<p>
    A good example of when an embedded language is actually interesting, is the <a href="https://www.acceleratehs.org/">Accelerate</a> project. Which is itself an
    embedded language that lets you describe parallel computations that can then be compiled to either CPU or even GPU code. The Accelerate language is,
    just like haskell or any other functional language, an embellished form of lambda calculus. As you will come to discover, pure lambda may be powerful
    enough, but is certainly not very pragmatic or intuitive at times. However, it forms a great basis from which you can later expand to create your
    own language.

<p>
    In this post we create multiple iterations of an embedded language (click to view source):

<p>
    The code in this post was heavily inspired by the <a href="https://github.com/VMatthijs/CHAD">CHAD: Combinatory Homomorphic Automatic Differentiation</a> project.
    Which is an embedded language for automatic differentiation. One of the authors of that project and an acquittance at Utrecht University, 
    <a href="https://tomsmeding.com">Tom Smeding</a>, whom I regularly trouble with my questions, also deserves some credit for answering those questions.

<h2>Lambda Calculus</h2>
<hr/>

<p>
    If you randomly stumbled upon this post, chances are that you already know what lambda calculus is. If not, let me give a quick overview.
</p>

<p>
    Lambda calculus is a programming language (of sorts) that is proven to be expressively equivalent to a Turing machine, a theoretical
    machine that forms the basis for the modern day computer.
    By extension, this means that like a Turing machine, any computation can be expressed as lambda calculus.
    What makes lambda calculus so interesting however, is its sheer simplicity.
    There are only 3 distinct concepts: variables, abstractions (i.e. functions), and function application.
    Refer to the following examples:
</p>

{% call macros.code("text") %}
x      : variable named x
λx.x   : function that takes an argument and simply returns it (identity function)
f x    : the variable x applied to the variable f (which is supposedly a function)

# Function application (reduce by taking the body of the abstraction, and substitute)
(λx.x) y          === y      (id y === y)

# more examples:

(λx.λy.y x) a b   === b a    (flip ($) a b === b a)
{% endcall %}

<p>
    With that short refresh out of the way, I would like to refer you to this most amazing presentation that tackles the subject of lambda calculus way better
    than I ever could. If you still feel confused, feel especially targeted as it is beginner friendly:
</p>

<h2>De Bruijn indices</h2>
<hr/>

The first problem we encounter is with the shadowing of variables. For example, the following expression is perfectly valid lambda calculus:

{% call macros.code("text") %}
λx.λx.x
{% endcall %}

Because a named variable simply refers to the most recent binding site, the outer x is never used. That means that when we apply something to this term,
no substitutions should take place, and the outer lambda should simply dissolve.

{% call macros.code("text") %}
(λx.λx.x) y  ===   λx.x
{% endcall %}

As such, it can be very helpful to instead of a name, use the distance to the binding site for each variable. Our previous expression then becomes:

{% call macros.code("text") %}
λ.λ.0
{% endcall %}

This way we do not have to consider shadowing, but just count when we want to substitute a variable. Let's setup a simple datastructure so that we
can get familiar with the concept of substitutions. In fact, we will start with the Simplest implementation possible, no type magic whatsoever.

<h2>Simplest: No types</h2>
<hr/>

We first define the datatype as well as a custom Show instance:

{% call macros.code("haskell") %}
data Term = Var Int | Lambda Term | App Term Term

instance Show Term where
    show (Var n) = "x" <> show n
    show (Lambda p) = "λ." <> show p
    show (App f arg) = "(" <> show f <> ") " <> show arg
{% endcall %}

With the AST in place, let us cook up the small test program from the previous chapter: A function that discards its first argument and returns the second.
Let's also apply two different variables to it to so that we can see how it reduces.
                                                                                                                              

{% call macros.code("haskell") %}
test :: Term
test = Lambda (Lambda (Var 0)) `App` Var 1 `App` Var 2
{% endcall %}

Note that this program is some sense not valid, since the applied variables are not in scope. They refer to a binding site outside of the epxression. 
The fact that this is possible in our language already alludes to fact that our embedded language might be a bit underspecified to enforce
correctness. However for now, it would be a great way to verify that our upcoming reduction routine works as expected. Because currently we have:

{% call macros.code("haskell") %}
ghci> test                                                                                                                                  
((λ.λ.x0) x1) x2
{% endcall %}

But we can reduce this expression by substituting terms that are applied. Let's whip up the function:

{% call macros.code("haskell") %}
-- subst variable with id n, with term sub, in a term
subst' :: Int -> Term -> Term -> Term
subst' n sub (Var n') = if n == n' then sub else Var n'
subst' n sub (Lambda p) = Lambda $ subst' (n+1) sub p
subst' n sub (App f arg) = App (subst' n sub f) (subst' n sub arg)

-- Commonly used when wishing to erase a lambda
subst = subst' 0

reduce :: Term -> Term
reduce (Var n) = Var n
reduce (Lambda p) = Lambda (reduce p)
reduce (App f arg) = let rf = reduce f in case rf of
    -- After substitution, more reduction opportunities may arise
    Lambda p -> reduce $ subst arg p
    -- The function argument could not be reduced
    _        -> App rf (reduce arg)
{% endcall %}

Which means we can now evaluate the reduction of our test function.

{% call macros.code("haskell") %}
reduce test
x2
{% endcall %}

All seems to be well :). Except of course the fact that it is an invalid program, because we end with a naked variable that references
a non existing value. Furthermore, there is not enough information to compile to, or rather evaluate, the expression back to normal haskell.
Due the lack of of type information, the following function cannot be implemented:

{% call macros.code("haskell") %}
eval :: Term -> a
eval = error "Not even Tom Cruise can do this..."
{% endcall %}

<h2>Harder: Typed expressions</h2>
<hr/>

Using the power of Generic Algebraic Datatypes (GADTs), we can inductively build up a return type as we construct a term:

{% call macros.code("haskell") %}
{-# LANGUAGE GADTs #-}
module Harder where

data Term a where
    Var :: Int -> Term a
    Lambda :: Term b -> Term (a -> b)
    App :: Term (a -> b) -> Term a -> Term b

instance Show (Term a) where
    show (Var n) = "x" <> show n
    show (Lambda p) = "λ." <> show p
    show (App f arg) = "(" <> show f <> ") " <> show arg
{% endcall %}

<p>
    Perhaps now we can implement the eval function that maps our embedded language back to the host language. Our evaluation strategy is as follows:
    every time we encounter a lambda, we return a lambda function and evaluate the body with that argument in the evaluation environment (a list).
    When we encounter a variable, we can simply index the list at its De Bruijn index to get the value.
</p>

<p>
    But we have a problem... The environment can contain terms of all sorts of types, but we cannot have a polymorphic list in haskell (not without more advanced features).
    Sadly, we can at best botch it with some unsafeCoerce sprinkles; we might just as well have used C.
</p>
                                    

{% call macros.code("haskell") %}
import Unsafe.Coerce

eval :: Term a -> a
eval = eval' []
    where eval' :: [t] -> Term a -> a
          eval' env (Var n) = unsafeCoerce $ env !! n
          eval' env (Lambda p) = \arg -> eval' (unsafeCoerce arg:env) p
          eval' env (App f arg) = eval f (eval arg)

-- But we can evaluate if we give the compiler some type hints
ghci> eval (Lambda (Lambda (Var 0))) 10 20 :: Int                                                                                                                
20
{% endcall %}

The same goes for the substitution function. We could make the error a bit more specific by using the Typeable typeclass (which adds runtime overhead), but that will not
solve the fundamental problem.

{% call macros.code("haskell") %}
subst' :: Int -> Term a -> Term b -> Term b
-- There is no evidence that a ~ b (cause it isn't always true...)
subst' n sub (Var n') = if n == n' then unsafeCoerce sub else Var n'
subst' n sub (Lambda p) = Lambda $ subst' (n+1) sub p
subst' n sub (App f arg) = App (subst' n sub f) (subst' n sub arg)
{% endcall %}


So what is that fundamental problem? It is that we cannot find any evidence for a ~ b because it simply is not true; Our embedded language classifies programs that are
invalid as admissible. We need stronger guarantees, and by extend more compile time information.

<h2>Complete: Type Environments</h2>
<hr/>

The ultimate crux is the environment from which variables get their values. If we encounter a variable with index 1, we must be sure that that binding site exists,
as well as as that the type of that variable matches with the value in the environment. The way to go about this is to keep track of a type level environment in
the Term datatype itself. This describes on the type level what kind of environment it needs to resolve all its variables. If that environment is empty, the
expression is closed and can be seen as a program that stands on its own.

{% call macros.code("haskell") %}
-- We get all the imports and language extensions out of the way
{-# LANGUAGE GADTs #-}
{-# LANGUAGE DataKinds #-}
{-# LANGUAGE TypeOperators #-}
{-# LANGUAGE Rank2Types #-}
{-# LANGUAGE LambdaCase #-}

module Complete where

import qualified Data.Map as M
import Data.Map (Map)
import Data.Maybe
import Data.Proxy
import Data.GADT.Compare
import Data.Type.Equality ((:~:)(Refl))

data Term env a where
    Var :: Idx env a -> Term env a
    Lambda :: Term (a ': env) b -> Term env (a -> b)
    App :: Term env (a -> b) -> Term env a -> Term env b

instance Show (Term env a) where
    show (Var x) = show x
    show (Lambda p) = "λ" <> "." <> "(" <> show p <> ")"
    show (App f arg@(Var _)) = show f <> " " <>  show arg
    show (App f arg) = show f <> " " <> "(" <> show arg <> ")"

-- Our programs should be of this type, implying that they are closed terms
type Exp = Term '[]
{% endcall %}

So what is Idx then? Because we don't want to be able to reference variables that are out of scope, we create a custom Church Encoding that tells the Var term
how many variables in its environment are needed at the least. Don't forget that there may be more variables available, that is not an issue. By adding variables we
say that an environment becomes weaker, but more on this later.


{% call macros.code("haskell") %}
-- | Typed De Bruijn index
data Idx env t where
    Z :: Idx (t ': env) t
    S :: Idx env t -> Idx (s ': env) t

-- Z = 0
-- S Z = 1
-- S (S Z) = 2
-- etc

idxToInt :: Idx env t -> Int
idxToInt Z = 0
idxToInt (S i) = 1 + idxToInt i

instance Show (Idx env t) where
    show = ("x"<>) . show . idxToInt
{% endcall %}

We use similar type magic to create a polymorphic list, that can serve as our runtime environment, allowing us to finally define eval without any caveats:

{% call macros.code("haskell") %}
data Env env where
    VZ :: Env '[]
    VS :: t -> Env env -> Env (t ': env)

envLookup :: Env env -> Idx env t -> t
envLookup (VS x _) Z = x
-- we decrement the index and the list in lockstep to count down
-- to the target value
envLookup (VS _ env) (S i) = envLookup env i

-- evaluation starts with an empty environment,
-- collecting variables each time we encounter an abstraction
eval :: Exp a -> a
eval = eval' VZ
    where eval' :: Env env -> Term env a -> a
          eval' env (Var i) = envLookup env i
          eval' env (Lambda e) = \arg -> eval' (VS arg env) e
          eval' env (App f e) = eval' env f (eval' env e)
{% endcall %}

Once again returning to our discard-the-first-argument-function, we no longer have to provide any typing information to evaluate it:

{% call macros.code("haskell") %}
ghci> eval (Lambda (Lambda (Var Z))) "ignore me" 420                                                                                        
420
{% endcall %}

Also, referencing variables that are out of scope is no longer possible (At least when trying to create something of type Exp).

{% call macros.code("haskell") %}
ghci> Lambda (Var (S Z)) :: Exp (a -> b)                               
<interactive>:4:1: error:
    • Couldn't match type: b1 : env0
                     with: '[]
      Expected: Exp (a1 -> b1)
        Actual: Term (b1 : env0) (a1 -> b1)
    • In the expression: Lambda (Var (S Z)) :: Exp (a -> b)
      In an equation for ‘it’: it = Lambda (Var (S Z)) :: Exp (a -> b)
{% endcall %}

<h3>Complete: Substitutions and beta reduction</h3>

Us awaits only one last feature: beta reduction. Before we can start on that, we first need a notion of equality for two indices that live in the same environment. 
Not only should we know that they are the same number, we should also learn that they must then refer to the same type. If we can observe that fact, we no
longer need any coercions. The perfect candidate for this is the Refl constructor from Data.Equality. It is roughly defined as:

{% call macros.code("haskell") %}
data IsEq a b where
    Refl :: IsEq a a
{% endcall %}

The effect is that encountering an instance of Refl, gives us the knowledge that a ~ b. Capturing both value and type equality is best done in this case using the
GEq typeclass:

{% call macros.code("haskell") %}
instance GEq (Idx env) where
    geq Z Z = Just Refl
    geq (S i) (S i') = geq i i'
    geq _ _ = Nothing
{% endcall %}

But if we then try to implement substitution, we run into a different problem:

{% call macros.code("haskell") %}
trySubst :: Idx env a -> Term env' a -> Term env t -> Term env' t
trySubst idx sub (Var i)
    | Just Refl <- geq idx i = sub
    | otherwise = Var i  -- error comes from here

--------------------------
 • Couldn't match type 'env' with 'env''
      Expected: Term env' t
        Actual: Term env t
{% endcall %}

But we cannot simply claim that the variable we are replacing has the same environment as the value we insert. 
It could be that originally the variable had index 1, but if we replace it by a term that is a variable with index 2.
This should be possible, if there are enough variables available in the environment.
But we should then convince the compiler that we can construct this env' by adding variables (i.e. weakening) env.
To aid this process we create a special type operator defines this weakening relation.
If we encounter such a proof, we are blessed with a runtime function that performs this weakening on indices for us.

{% call macros.code("haskell") %}
-- Proof that env is at least as strong as env', unlocks a function
-- that performs the weakening
newtype env :> env' = Weaken { (>:>) :: forall t'. Idx env t' -> Idx env' t' }

-- A custom operator that allows us to chain two weakening operations
infixr 9 .>
(.>) :: env2 :> env3 -> env1 :> env2 -> env1 :> env3
Weaken f .> Weaken g = Weaken (f . g)

-- A basic lemma, any environment is at least as strong as itself
wId :: env :> env
wId = Weaken id

-- We can always make the weaker environment weaker
wSucc :: env :> env' -> env :> (t : env')
wSucc = (Weaken S .>)

-- We can always make the stronger environment stronger
wRaise :: (t' : env) :> env' -> env :> env'
wRaise = (.> Weaken S)

-- We can weaken two environments in simultaneously
wSink :: env :> env' -> (t ': env) :> (t ': env')
wSink w = Weaken (\case Z -> Z ; S i -> S (w >:> i))

-- Lift the weakening operation to terms
-- i.e. just propagate to the Var cases
sinkTerm :: env :> env' -> Term env t -> Term env' t
sinkTerm w (Var i) = Var (w >:> i)
sinkTerm w (Lambda e) = Lambda (sinkTerm (wSink w) e)
sinkTerm w (App f arg) = App (sinkTerm w f) (sinkTerm w arg)

-- An often used simplification
sinkTerm1 :: Term env t -> Term (a ': env) t
sinkTerm1 = sinkTerm (wSucc wId)
{% endcall %}

So armed with environment weakening, let's retry the substitution function, by requiring that a proof is given about these two environments.

{% call macros.code("haskell") %}
subst :: env :> env' -> Term env' u -> Term (u ': env) t -> Term env' t
subst w = subst' weakening Z
    where weakening = Weaken $ \case
                            -- This case is actually unreachable
                            Z -> error "variable should have been replaced"
                            S i -> w >:> i


subst' :: env :> env' -> Idx env a -> Term env' a -> Term env t -> Term env' t
subst' w n sub (Var n')
    | Just Refl <- geq n n' = sub
    | otherwise = Var (w >:> n')
subst' w n sub (Lambda e) = Lambda (subst' (wSink w) (S n) (sinkTerm1 sub) e)
subst' w n sub (App f arg) = App (subst' w n sub f) (subst' w n sub arg)
{% endcall %}

Take a moment to appreaciate what exactly is going on here as it is a lot to comprehend. I don't expect you to fully understand it without
playing around with it yourself. If on the other hand you do trust that this function does what it promises, you will be glad to discover
that beta reduction is now nearly trivial:                                                                                                                              

{% call macros.code("haskell") %}
reduce :: Term env a -> Term env a
reduce (Var n) = Var n
reduce (App f arg) = let rf = reduce f in case rf of
    Lambda f' -> reduce $ subst wId arg f'
    _ -> App rf (reduce arg)
reduce (Lambda e) = Lambda $ reduce e
{% endcall %}

Let's try out a little demo. If we take the now infamous discardfirst function, and we feed it itself as both arguments, it should return simply the second argument which is itself.
After beta reduction this should become obvious.

{% call macros.code("haskell") %}
ghci> discardfirst

<h3>Complete: Summary, Limitations, Future</h3>

Well done if you have made it this far. Likely you are either very excited, or very frustrated at this point. If the first is the case, I wish to end on a slightly sour
note by pointing out that our strongly typed lambda calculus is not as powerful as vanilla lambda calculus. For example, take the famous Mockingbird combinator, that applies
a given function to itself:

{% call macros.code("haskell") %}
--| λf.f f

mockingbird = Lambda $ App (Var Z) (Var Z)

• Couldn't match type a with a -> b
      Expected: Term ((a -> b) : env) a
        Actual: Term ((a -> b) : env) (a -> b)
{% endcall %}

<p>
    We could never define this function because the types would never be possible. Namely, being on the left side of the application, variable 0 must be a function, say some a -> b.
    However, because it is its own argument, we find that it must also be of type a. We could then say that instead we type it as (a -> b) -> b. But then we are stuck for the
    same reason, with no end to the cycle...

<p>
    The same problem arouses with the y-combinator, which introduces a form of recursion in lambda calculus. All in all, it seems that our typed version is much less expressive,
    and that is indeed true. I would argue that just typed lambda calculus also does not make that much sense. Instead it would be more sensible to use the type environment only as
    as 'count the number of binding sites' environment. That way we can still ensure that variables are not out of scope, but without the typing conflicts. 
</p>

<p>
    But what we can be looking at, is the start of a more extensive functional embedded language. If we instead introduce more Term inhabitants, such as a constant integer value,
    along with an Add operation, lists, etc. We could still design a language that is some ways restricted so that we may compile it to certain platforms, or allow for an
    otherwise hard or impossible analysis. And that is what I believe <a href="https://www.acceleratehs.org/">Accelerate</a> exactly to be.

    For the true fans of lambda calculus, I dedicate this chapter. Lambda calculus is beautiful because it doesn't need types as such. If you think about it, it is impossible for
    a pure lambda calculus expression to be type incorrect. The only place of concern for beta reduction is the application, what if the function argument is not a Lambda expression?
    First option is that is a variable, which references a binding site and may in the future be substituted with a different term. Second and final option would be that it is itself an
    application, which we can beta reduce again. Therefore the only thing that really matters is that variables are in scope!
</p>

<p>
    We could easily change the list environment of the Complete module, and replace it just with natural numbers that count how many variables are scope. If a Term references no variables
    with a higher number, then we know the outer term to be closed. Anything that is of type Exp is therefore a valid lambda calculus expression. Furthermore, we are now free to apply functions
    to themselves, as well as create any other amazing combinator that is named after a bird :)
