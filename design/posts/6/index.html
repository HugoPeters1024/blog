<h2>Introduction</h2>
My mother is a teacher on a primary school at which she often works with the gifted kids that
yearn for an extra challenge. One of these challenges she provided them was called the <i>Boomerang Problem</i><sup>1</sup>.
The goal of the challenge is to find the largest number that cannot be represented as the sum of multiples of two given numbers (called the boomerangs).
So for example, given the number 4 and 5, you can construct 17 as 3 * 4 + 1 * 5. However, the number 11 cannot be represented that
way and is therefore the answer to our problem. In this post we will try to formulate a generic method for finding this largest number
given any two boomerangs.



<h2>Euclid would like to interject for a moment</h2>
<p>
Before we try to answer the question of the largest number we must asks ourselved first: does such a number always exist? And in fact, this
happens to not always be the case. The easiest counter example that you can think of is when the two boomerangs are even numbers. After all,
both the sum and a multiple of even numbers remain even. As a result, two even boomerangs will never be able to express an odd number, making
the question "What is the largest number that cannot be expressed?", rather nonsensical.
</p>

<p>
Even numbers carry with them a property that troubles the water in the same way that 6 and 9 are two boomerangs for which the question becomes non-sensical.
Namely, they are both a multiple of a number other than 1. This number number is known as the Greatest Common Divider (Or GCD for short). We know that if the
GCD of two numbers is some number z, that z+1 can never be expressed. 
</p>

<p>
Luckily there is a relatively simple method for determining the GCD which is known as the Euclidian Algorithm<sup>2</sup>.
