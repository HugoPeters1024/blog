      <h2>What do we want</h2>

      <p>
        What better way to start of a programming blog by writing a
        piece on how I build this website itself? 
      </p>

      <p>
        Let's kick it off with defining our requirements:
        <ul>
          <li>Learn something</li>
          <li>Little maintance</li>
          <li>Easy to add and update posts</li>
          <li>Ability to show code snippets</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h2>The old way is the gold way: static html</h2>

      <p>
      Initially I started building a setup in Nodejs with nunjucks (a Jinja
      templating engine). Whilst I rarely use javascript I've always been
      attracted to the functional syntax of Nodejs and it's asynchronous nature.
      However, in a discussion with a former peer student who has some years of
      experience in DevOps, I learned that since data changes are rare and
      request agnostic, a static site would be more sensical. This idea would also
      tie in nicely with our low maintance requirement since we only need to care
      about keeping a trivial nginx server alive, which I know to be quite 
      trivial.
      <p>

      <p>
      Incidently, I also played a small role in making a static photo gallery
      for my study association which was to be placed behind a login to abide by
      GDPR guidelines. This project contained a few templates along with a python
      applications to build and manage the website and it's state. I decided to
      borrow heavily from this setup. This project is also open source by the way
      (<a href="https://www.github.com/svsticky/pxl" target="_blank">github</a>)
      </p>

      <h2>Our plan</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Define the state</li>
        <li>Create Jinja2 templates to render the state</li>
        <li>Create a python based cli to manage the state and build the site</li>
        <li>Create an nginx configurations to serve files (without extensions in uri)</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>1. Defining the state</h3>
      Being a very simple blog, it seems adequeate that our state is merely a list of posts.
      Let's define our types using the marvelous dataclasses introduced into python3.7:

      {% call macros.code("python") %}
        @dataclass
        class Post:
            number: int
            title: str
            postedAt: datetime

        @dataclass
        class State:
            posts: List[Post]
      {% endcall %}

      Also, be warned. I use type annotations in python. They do not have any effect on the
      functionality but are used to enforce a typesystem using static analysis. You can read
      more about it here: <a href="http://mypy-lang.org/" target="_blank">mypy</a>.

      <p>
      Also, I left out the code for json parsing here since it is quite straightforward.
      The state file might look something like this:
      </p>
      {% call macros.code("json") %}
      {
          "posts": 
          [
              {
                  "number": 0,
                  "title": "test_post",
                  "postedAt": "2019-11-01T16:54:42"
              },
              {
                  "number": 1,
                  "title": "Making a blog website",
                  "postedAt": "2019-11-01T17:22:20"
              }
          ]
      }
      {% endcall %}

      <h3>2. Creating templates</h3>

      <p>
      Blogposts I love are those that contain clear, copyable code snippets. It goes then
      without saying that I should adhere by the same standard. My forementioned friend that
      advised build a static site, also recommended <a href="http://pygments.org">pygments</a> 
      to convert plain text code into syntax highlighted html. The great thing about Jinja is
      the flexible way in which you can provide your template with custom functions. These means
      that we can write our highlight function the way we normally would in python and then
      simply inject it into our Jinja context.
      </p>

      {% call macros.code("python") %}
        def highlight(lang: str, code: str) -> str:
            formatter = HtmlFormatter()
            lex = pygments.lexers.get_lexer_by_name(lang)
            return str(pygments.highlight(code, lex, formatter))

        def build() -> None:
          # Create a Jinja context with /design/pages/ as root
          env = jinja2.Environment(loader=jinja2.FileSystemLoader("design/pages/"))
          env.globals["highlight"] = highlight
          # Then simply render all templates to eponymous files
          # in the build directory
      {% endcall %}


      <p>
      Now in our template we can easily call that function. However, because our code is
      generally a multiline string contained all kinds of different strings themselves, it
      would be a strenious task to somehow pipe all that text as argument. Not to mention
      the appalling syntax we would have to swallow writing blogposts! Instead I found this
      beautiful way to call a macro in jinja
      </p>
      {% call macros.code("html") %}
        {% raw %}
          <!-- imported somewhere in the base template -->
          {% macro code(language) -%}
              {{ highlight(language, caller()) }}
          {%- endmacro %}

          <!-- while writing a blog post -->
          {% call macros.code("python") %}
            def main():
              print("my source code is not a nice string")
              return 0;
          {% endcall %}
        {% endraw %}
      {% endcall %}

      <p>
      Effectively, you can use the caller() method to load in the literal string
      that was typed between the call block. This circumvents the need of awkwardly passing code
      containing all kinds of weird characters as argument to the macro directly. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
      At this time I was introduced to another problem however; code segments are placed
      between 'pre' (preformated) tags. That means that the indent I so nicely added to my
      templates to keep things readible, where now also showing up in the final result.
      Evidently I could not simply remove a white space from the start of every line because I
      want to be able to present indented code snippets in a frivolous attempt to make the
      impression that I write tidy code. Fixing this would require not us to consider all the
      lines of code in the snippet simultaneously. What we want to the remove the leading indent
      of the snippet, or in other words remove all indent that is shared between all the lines.
      Let's fix our highlight function to statisfy this new constraint:
      </p>

      {% call macros.code("python") %}
      def highlight(lang: str, code: str) -> str:
          formatter = HtmlFormatter()

          # special all() function that return false for empty sets
          alln: Callable[[List[Any]], bool] = lambda l: all(l) and len(l) > 0

          # Remove all shared whitespace
          lines = code.split("\n")
          while alln([str(x)[0].isspace() for x in lines if len(x) > 0]):
              for i in range(len(lines)):
                  if len(lines[i]) > 0:
                      lines[i] = lines[i][1:]
          code = "\n".join(lines)
          lex = pygments.lexers.get_lexer_by_name(lang)
          return str(pygments.highlight(code, lex, formatter))
      {% endcall %}


      <h3>3. Management CLI</h3>
      <p>
      This will be the gatekeeper to our state. It is this cli we will use for building the site
      as well as creating new posts.
      </p>
      <p>
      Over the years I've created loads of small cli programs. But until recently they always
      sucked. I've had dotnet projects with 30 different attributes all doing weird type
      reflecion logic to slowly consume a command and eventually select a method to execute.
      </p>

      <p>
      But all my troubles seemed to have been solved by the wonderful 
      <a href="https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/7.x/" target="_blank">click</a> package. 
      It allowed me to effortlesly create commands and subgroups to eventually come to the
      following set of commands:
      </p>

      {% call macros.code("sh") %}
        blog init          # create an empty state.json file
        blog build         # copy and render source files to build location
        blog preview       # serve build directory in browser
        blog post create   # copy post template to new directory in the source and append to the state
        blog post edit     # open a post's directory in vim 
        blog post delete   # remove a post from the state
      {% endcall %}

      <h3>4. Nginx configuration</h3>
      Now that we have everything setup, we just need a way to serve the files. For this we
      only need a simple and short nginx configuration that simply looks for the file specified
      in the uri. To avoid having ugly looking uri's that end in .html, we simply leverage
      the fact that nginx simply looks for index.html if no file is specified. So you, my dear
      reader, only sees <i>/posts/1</i> for example, which in actuality is interpreted as
      <i>/posts/1/index.html</i>.


      {% call macros.code("nginx") %}
      http {
        include /etc/nginx/conf/mime.types;
        default_type application/octet-stream;

        server {
          listen 80;

          root /var/www/blog;
          index index.html index.htm index.php;

          server_name blog;

          location / {
            try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
          }
        }
      }
      events { }
      {% endcall %}

      <h2>We want more, but mmm</h2>
      During any coding project I find myself always arriving at that feeling; You want to
      add a feature but it just doesn't really play nice with the existing codebase. In this
      case it was the feature of showing the last modified time the bottom of a post's page.
      Getting the information is quite straightforward using Pathlib, but this is information
      that was not in our original state. Previously we could think of our pipeline as follows:

      {% call macros.code("haskell") %}
      build :: "state.json" -> State -> html 
      {% endcall %}

      But we now want to fetch extra data at runtime and add this to the state. To keep our
      typesystem as an ally we therefore have to adjust our plan to this:

      {% call macros.code("haskell") %}
      build:: "state.json" -> State -> PreparedState -> html
      {% endcall %}

      We need to then create another set of types to represent this new state. While we're
      added I also decided to leverage this functionality to the abstract from a seperate
      file as well, this way I prevent myself from ever having to edit the state.json file, as
      well as keeping it clean.

      {% call macros.code("python") %}
      @dataclass
      class PreparedPost(Post):
          modifiedAt: datetime
          abstract: str

      @dataclass
      class PreparedState:
          posts: List[PreparedPost]
      {% endcall %}

      And a finally a function for our conversion step:

      {% call macros.code("python") %}
      def prepareState(state: State, root: Path) -> PreparedState:
          posts_dir = root / "posts"
          prepared_posts = []
          for post in state.posts:
              post_path = posts_dir / str(post.number)

              modifiedAt = lastModified(post_path)

              # load the abstract
              abstract = "abstract not available"
              abstract_path = post_path / "abstract.html"
              if abstract_path.exists():
                  with open(abstract_path, "r") as f:
                      abstract = f.read()

              prepared_posts.append(
                  PreparedPost(post.number,
                  post.title,
                  post.postedAt,
                  modifiedAt,
                  abstract)
              )

          return PreparedState(prepared_posts)
      {% endcall %}

      And that's it! We now have access to two more properties when rendering posts
      in the template. Although it might seem a little tedious to have created a new
      type, I do think that the redudancy there is a good tradeoff for making the
      fetching of extra data a very explicit and maintainable step.

      <h2>Looking back</h2>

      <p>
      We have the our design directory that contains all of our templates and other files that I
      might need in any future posts, conviently boxed in their own subdirectory. In our build
      folder we have now have the exact same tree structure except that the files are new
      rendered with the data provided by the state.json file (also I deleted the templates
      directory). I am particularly pleased by the simplicity of it all. Now we have all the 
      time in the world to fiddle with the layout and conjure a custom 404 page with images
      of cute animals.
