  <p>
    Hi, I am Hugo, currently doing a masters in programming technologies at the University
    of Utrecht. On this blog I share things I've learned from coding projects that I
    found interesting. This can range from very technical depth about the theory behind
    something, to smart decision making and creating a maintainable project. My interest
    lie generally in anything GPU related, writing efficient code, and a sprinkle of functional
    programming on top.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  More recently I have also become very intrigued by the field of cyber security and spent a healthy
  amount of time on <a href="https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/users/profile/226598">Hack the Box</a>. Currently
  I am investigating possibilities of doing any security related work next to masters, to keep things as broad as
  possible.
